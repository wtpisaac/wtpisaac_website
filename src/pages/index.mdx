I don't have a Mastodon/Instagram/Twitter/Reddit/Facebook etc. as of 2024, and I don't 
use LinkedIn as a social platform. Most social media is pretty unfun these
days - but I'm happy to receive an email if you want to get ahold of me, and
I'd love to see your blog/website :).

# Current Projects

## web project (TBA, FOSS)
I am working on a web project intended to enable cataloguing and browsing the
open web easier, which I find important given the issues with modern web
search. The project will be free-and-open-source, with a wiki-style data
license and data contribution model.

This project is still in design/prototyping phase, but you can peek at my 
Codeberg for my prototyping if you're curious.

If you are interested in the open web, and want to hear my ideas in full or
contribute some, please contact me! (email at top of page). I'd love to network
with people who want to help restore and promote an open web beyond the silos
and limitations of social media.

## insprng (iOS) [[Download on the App Store]](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/insprng-inspiring-quotes/id1640221466)
insprng is a motivational quotes app for iOS; you can grab it free of charge
from the App Store.

The app uses SwiftUI for UI presentation logic, and SQLite to store and retrieve quotes. Quotes are sourced from a
well-known quotes CSV, and are manually curated. SQLite logic within the app is written in C and bound to Swift by hand,
with no third-party libraries used.

## Sluggo Issue Tracker (2020-21)
As a side project under Slugbotics, myself and other contributors worked to create a FOSS alternative to JIRA targeting
small teams. The goal was to offer an issue tracker that would appeal to small teams, with a simple workflow and modern
UI.

Two versions of the issue tracker exist:
- A [prototype version](https://github.com/Sluggo-Issue-Tracker/Sluggo-py4web) made in [py4web](https://py4web.com/), a
  Python server-side-rendering framework
- A [rewrite](https://github.com/Sluggo-Issue-Tracker/Sluggo-API) which created an API-driven version of the issue
tracker. Frontends include [Web](https://github.com/Sluggo-Issue-Tracker/Sluggo-SPA) and
[iOS](https://github.com/Sluggo-Issue-Tracker/Sluggo-iOS).

I contributed the overall design goals for the project, and served as the initial Product Owner. I contributed alongside
[Andrew Gavgavian](https://www.linkedin.com/in/agavgavi/) and [Sam
Schmidt](https://www.linkedin.com/in/samuel-schmidt-67977a179/) on the initial prototype. I also spearheaded development
on the [Web (Vue)](https://github.com/Sluggo-Issue-Tracker/Sluggo-SPA) frontend for the rewrite, and contributed
alongside [Andrew Gavgavian](https://www.linkedin.com/in/agavgavi/), [Sam
Schmidt](https://www.linkedin.com/in/samuel-schmidt-67977a179/), Stephan Martin, and [Troy
Ebert](https://www.linkedin.com/in/troy-ebert-26755a241/) for the [iOS (UIKit)
frontend](https://github.com/Sluggo-Issue-Tracker/Sluggo-iOS-UIKit).

Due to health issues, I left the project in 2021. I wish the team well if the project picks up again - it was a blast to
work with everyone :).

The issue tracker source code can be found at [GitHub.](https://github.com/Sluggo-Issue-Tracker)

## CMPM 80K (Game Design) @ UCSC (2020)
I created two small games while taking a game design course at UCSC.

### Violet (Twine) [AGPLv3+ or CC BY-NC-ND 4.0] [[Play Now!]](/violetgame/violet.html)
The first game - Violet - utilizes the Twine engine to create a link-and-text driven game. In the game, you are a
detective investigating disappearances in an abandoned town.

I drew heavy inspiration from the [Amnesia series of games](https://amnesia.fandom.com/wiki/Amnesia_(series)) when
developing Violet, particularly from The Dark Descent and Justine. Flashbacks occur via a lantern with a fade to white,
a direct reference to Alexander's memories in The Dark Descent; a morality system is implemented which is tied to the
outcome of interactive puzzles within the game - with the success or failure rate of the puzzles affecting the game's
ending, as in Justine. Finally, a Journal mechanic was implemented to keep a persistent context of clues which are
discovered in the game, helping to ground the player's objectives as they progress.

Originally, I released the game to 
[UCSC CGPM's eScholarship site](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/2k41w4gd)
under the **CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 license**. You are free to use the game under that license,
or to consider the game as released under the **GNU Affero General Public 
License version 3 or later, at your option.** If you make a derivative of the
game or something else using the work, let me know :D.

### Climate Command (Godot) (w/ Cody Cochlin) [CC0-1.0] [[Download (Windows / WINE)]](/climatecommandgame/ClimateCommand.exe)
The second game, Climate Command, is a simple Missile Command clone. The objective of the assignment was to reimplement
a classic game with its mechanics adapted to a different theme. In this recreation, incoming missiles are replaced by
solar rays, and the towers deploy planes to perform geoengineering to try and stop the demise of climate change. It's a
fairly simple game.

The art for this game were created by my late friend Cody Cochlin, who passed away in 2021. I miss him very much in
these difficult times.

I would like to call out in my friend's honor the [Cody Cochlin Memorial
Scholarship](https://bold.org/scholarships/cody-cochlin-memorial-scholarship/) which is funded and maintained by Jaedan
Ford. If you are a low-income student who needs financial assistance for college, and enjoy performing tricks with a
skateboard, rollerblade, rollerskate, or snowboard - please apply.

## Slugbotics (2018-21)
I participated on [Slugbotics](https://slugbotics.com/) at UC Santa Cruz from 2018 to 2021. Slugbotics is a student
robotics team participating in the underwater MATE competition, where teams work to create underwater ROVs which can
perform a variety of tasks.

My contributions included creating and maintaining the [team website](https://slugbotics.com/) using a static site
generator (Hugo), as well as architecting some of the onboard systems for BIG SLAB, which utilized a Raspberry Pi,
Arduino, and ESCs to enable remote control.

Beyond direct programming contributions, I contributed to several broader team initiatives as a team lead. I worked with
[Andrew Gavgavian](https://www.linkedin.com/in/agavgavi/) to overhaul the team's software subteam onboarding, in order
to enable newcomers to make effective contributions - including teaching how to use a *nix command line, how to use Git,
and how to write graphical application code.

I'm proud of the work I did on the team, and I hope they do well into the
future :D.

# Things in Progress
This website isn't quite complete. Some things not yet done, in no particular
order:

- Adding more photos of things onto this website
- Adding project pages for new projects onto this website
- Adding a blog section and RSS feed to publish posts
- Creating a secondary website for nonprofessional stuff, such as music
production
- Update Violet to include proper license information

I'm pretty busy these days with work, so these will be here eventually&#8482;,
when I can find time to do them. No schedule on any of it, unfortunately :P.
